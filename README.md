# WebDesign-HTML5CSS
This is the first draft of a responsive webpage from the textbook Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS. 
This is chapter one example. There weren't any issues that arose (I pretty much followed along from the Github file, while reading in the book). 
One thing that stood out was the Media query. The way I understand it: set the styles for the smallest screen you are creating for (those are the base styles for the page); then the elements that will change on larger screens will be styled in a media query (directives in CSS that allow us to isolate CSS rules to certain environment conditions).
FYI: There are a few different Medial Queries. In this example, the only type of media query used is: a minimum-width media query. CSS rules within this type of media query only get applied if the viewpoint is or exceeds a certain width.
